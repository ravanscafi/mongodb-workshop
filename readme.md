Slides for my MongoDB Workshop, made in Brazilian Portuguese for [PHP Community Summit](https://php.locaweb.com.br/).

It's currently hosted at [my website](https://mongodb-workshop.ravan.me/).

I've used the awesome [mdx-deck](https://github.com/jxnblk/mdx-deck) project and a lot of jerry-rigs, sorry.

Note to future self: There's a <kbd>opt</kbd>+<kbd>f</kbd> command to go fullscreen.
